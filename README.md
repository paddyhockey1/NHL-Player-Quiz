# Quiz Features

## Multiple Choice

This allows the user with little to no hockey knowledge the chance to choose an option whether the player they are choosing is familiar to them or not. The user must choose who the player is based on the portrait contained above the potential answers.

## Correct Answer Display

Should the user select the wrong answer, the correct answer will be the only button remaining allowing the user to easily identify the correct answer. The correct answer has an in-built CSS feature that displays the correct answer in a different colour to the answer tiles prior to the user's choice.

## Clickable Home Button

There is a home button, made responsive through javascript, located at the bottom of each quiz page that allows the user to return to the home page should they wish to. This can be clicked at any time throughout the quiz.

![home-button](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/d4213921-c446-49ea-8096-02b22d1796f4)

## Mobile Responsiveness 

The site has been designed to be used on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Both the homepage and the quiz page are responsive to the chosen device screen regardless of screen dimensions. This allows for a better user experience for users on mobile devices.

![mobile-home-page](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/9f2af8b8-40a6-4b1d-bba1-56330aa18234) ![mobile-quiz-page](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/b3bc45b4-406e-42a5-ab62-11fe7a0e3288)

## Score Alert Window

When the user has completed a quiz, an alert window will appear on their screen indicating that the quiz is complete and their score.

![window-alert](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/18192791-7287-4fbf-b86f-1ce16390addb)

## Future Features

* I would like to include more interactivity within the site on the user's completion of the quiz. These could include: background-music, animations and potentially video of the players in the quiz.

* A feature whre the player's score could be entered and stored would add to the user experience.

* The inclusion of more potential questions for each topic contained within the page and the option to randomize both the questions asked and the order in which they appear would make the quiz feature less predictable. The option of ten questions instead of the current five would also add longevity to the quiz aspect of the site.

* I would llike to include more topics within a future site. These could include seperating players by position, by decade played and by each team.

* A timer could be incoporated to inform the user of how long they have spent on each quiz and possibly each question. There could also be a time-limit for both individual questions and quizzes.

* A more visually appealing home page could be added with more advanced HTML and CSS coding to make the divs and images create a more uniform shape or design.

*  # Testing

## HTML

[W3C Markup Validation Testing(https://validator.w3.org/) found no errors with my HTML code.

![w3c-html](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/4949d952-f7ae-4e7a-adab-75b912573709)

## CSS

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) found no errors with my CSS code.

![w3c-css](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/7ac01615-5df1-40bd-b7e6-38d063ce35c4)

## JavaScript

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) found no errors in the JavaScript Code.

![js-hint](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/3efec5b4-e6f5-4e36-b1df-1bc66bfa8a00)

## Lighthouse Report

![lighthouse-report-desktop](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/9e378fba-4bc8-4dd6-8e15-2a90aa51e822)

* Lighthouse found that some of the images I used were bigger than the CSS styling I coded. I used the smaller image dimensions to increase the aesthetics of the pages.

## Wave Report

![wave-report](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/NHL-Player-Quiz/assets/170856162/9372523e-8fdd-4e5c-8827-f37b9055b5fb)

* Wave found no errors but recommended some improvements regarding contrast in the headings for elements. The program was reacting to the text-shadow property and the similiarity between that colour and the page background colour.

## Bugs 

* I encountered an issue a hover feature onn the mobile version would remain on the quiz's answer button after the page changed to the next question. I remedied this by simply removing the hover feature.

* I encountered an issue with the score alert not appearing when a quiz was completed. The solution to this was to create a new div in the quiz-container element within the index page.

## Unfixed Bugs

* There is a visual bug within the Firefix browser where the background radiant appears sharper than in other browsers I have tested. I have tried: Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, and 
  Duckduckgo. This error only seems to occur within the desktop browser as I deployed my page to the Firefox mobile browser and did not encounter any issues. After further research 
  online, I found that this appeared to be a common issue with Firefox not displaying background-gradient patterns in a similar fashion to other browsers, both desktop and mobile.

  * Some of the boxes that contain answers will not align directly under question image on Safari on iOS as they do in other mobile browsers. I have tried this in a number of mobile browsers such as: Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Duckduckgo and have not experienced this issue on any of them, even using these other browsers on mobile iOS.

 # Deployment

  * The site was created using Gitpod and deployed through Github using the repository "NHL-Player-Quiz".

# Credits 

* I would like to thank my facilitator, my mentor, and my fellow classmates for their help with both my webpage and my README file.

  ## Media

  * A large portion of the player portraits that were used in this site were pulled from [NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com), especially the [players page](https://www.nhl.com/player).
 
  * The iamge for one player, Vladislav Tretiak, had to be sourced from this site [Vladislav Tretiak](https://the-avocado.org/2021/04/25/the-vladislav-tretiak-night-thread/) as he never played in the NHL and therefore does not have an official portrait.
 
  * The images for the Anaheim Ducks, NHL and Hockey Hall of Fame were sourced from Wikipedia. The Mighty Ducks logo was sourced from [PNG Wing](https://www.pngwing.com/en/free-png-ivtui).
 
  ## Content
* Additional JavaScript for the more advanced JavaScript quiz elements was modelled on [European countries](https://github.com/l-copeman/european-countries)

* I learned much of the easier JavaScript properties from the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoSksQ4s_hg&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET) YouTube Channel as I found the Code Institute LMS more difficult to grasp.

* I used the following book [JavaScript in Easy Steps](https://ineasysteps.com/products-page/javascript-easy-steps-6th-edition/) to learn more about the JavaScript language. I purchased this book prior to the commencement of this course.
